# Seatbelt-Releases
(Original Repo](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt)
The releases are on the releases folder. Download the one you want. All releases were compiled with:
* Visual Studio 2019
* .NET Framework SDK version 3.1.401
* Windows 10 x64

I have no clue how to check if the compiled executable is x64 or x86. I just know it works on my x64 machine.
